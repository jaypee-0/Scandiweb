3. ``` The cart icon should not represent 0 items in that black circle, only if 1 or more items are added ```
4. ``` The header should be sticky ```
5. ``` Cart overlay should be closed on click outside, page redirect ```
6. ``` Product cards should have the name and brand together ```
7. ``` Prices and total should be displayed as valid prices (with 2 decimals after the dot), check different currencies ```
8. The green button on product cards should add the product to the cart (with the first attributes in case of the configurable product)
9. ``` If only one item in the cart should be written 1 item, not 1 items ```
10. add to cart not always working
11. ``` If the quantity of images is more than the number of images that fit in the column of the left gallery max-height should be set and scroll implemented ```
12. ``` The image slider on the cart page is not implemented ```
13. ``` The z-index on the cart page is broken ```
14. ``` Being on clothes requests all categories and all products ```
15. ``` It is not good practice to request everything in one request, please run each request separately ```
